### Asymptotic Analysis of Linear Search vs. Binary Search

---

#### **Linear Search:**
- **Best Case:** \(O(1)\)
- **Worst Case:** \(O(n)\)
- **Average Case:** \(O(n)\)

#### **Binary Search:**
- **Best Case:** \(O(1)\)
- **Worst Case:** \(O(\log n)\)
- **Average Case:** \(O(\log n)\)

---

### **Advantages of Linear Search:**
1. **Versatility:** A general-purpose search algorithm that can operate on any dataset, regardless of order.
2. **No Sorting Requirement:** Works on both sorted and unsorted data structures.
3. **Simplicity:** Linear asymptotic upper bound with straightforward implementation.

### **Disadvantages of Linear Search:**
1. **Lower Efficiency:** Typically slower than binary search for larger datasets.
2. **Inefficient Worst Case:** In the worst case, requires a complete iteration over the entire dataset.

---

### **Advantages of Binary Search:**
1. **Higher Efficiency:** Significantly faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.
2. **Divide and Conquer:** Repeatedly divides the dataset in half based on comparisons with the median, reducing search space logarithmically.
3. **Optimized Complexity:** Worst-case time complexity is \(O(\log n)\), offering superior performance for sorted data.

### **Disadvantages of Binary Search:**
1. **Sorting Requirement:** Applicable only on datasets sorted in ascending order, which can add preprocessing time if the data is unsorted.
